Suddenly Polina rose from the window, approached the table, and, looking at me with an expression of infinite aversion, said with lips which quivered with anger:</p><p>"Well? Are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs?"</p><p>"Polina, you say that AGAIN, AGAIN?" I exclaimed.</p><p>"You have changed your mind, then? Ha, ha, ha! You are sorry you ever promised them?"</p><p>On the table where, the previous night, I had counted the money there still was lying the packet of twenty five thousand florins. I handed it to her.</p><p>"The francs are mine, then, are they? They are mine?" she inquired viciously as she balanced the money in her hands.</p><p>"Yes; they have ALWAYS been yours," I said.</p></div> </div>
