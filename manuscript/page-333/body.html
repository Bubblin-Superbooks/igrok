Polina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there; after which she always smiled."</p><p>"Indeed? No, I was not there; but I was waiting in the corridor, and walking about the hotel."</p><p>"She ought to see a doctor, you know, Mr. Astley."</p><p>"Yes, she ought. I have sent for one, and, if she dies, I shall hold you responsible."</p><p>This surprised me.</p><p>"Pardon me," I replied, "but what do you mean?"</p><p>"Never mind. Tell me if it is true that, last night, you won two hundred thousand thalers?"</p><p>"No; I won a hundred thousand florins."</p><p>"Good heavens! Then I suppose you will be off to Paris this morning?</p><p>"Why?"</p></div> </div>
